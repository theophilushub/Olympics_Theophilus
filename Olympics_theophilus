Observation and Recommendation
According to the analysis china has the best performance overall with highest number of gold, highest number of silver and as well highest number of bronze medal. 
China has the best performance of the year without doubt
I also observe that china is the best and also ranked the number one country not by anything else but by the influence and performance. 
However, I will recommend that other countries should emulate China by investing more time into the sport activities. Also encourage them to try more in investing and allowing small children as low as grade 1 or from the primary level to help and bring out the talent in them 
Also i will recommend that the should look inward and scout for great talents within the country and their citizens in diaspora.
Further more, they can introduce new sport competitions with attracting prices in order to attract the attention of their citizens with great talent who will not just because of the prices come out but also to put them on a scale of performance and competitive performance.
